# Copycat

Sometimes, thinking of a brand-new-revolutionary-world-changer project is very hard and you just want to improve or test your own skills by remaking some great projects you just saw on the web. Well, this is my space for doing it.

If you want to see my original ideas and random stuff, please check my [playground repo](https://github.com/guilhermemj/playground).

## To copy, not to steal

The purpose of this repo is to learn and practice only. Everything made here will have a mention on the project which inspired it and a link whenever possible.

If you find something you did here, please consider it a homage, but if you want it to be removed don't hesitate in opening an issue (or contacting me directly) and it will be gone right away.
