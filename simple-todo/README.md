# Simple Todo

A simple to-do list made with VanillaJS. Based on the [project with the same name](http://cauequeiroz.com.br/simpletodo/) by [Caue Queiroz](http://cauequeiroz.com.br/about/).

* Add/Remove tasks;
* Mark items as completed;
* Integrated with localStorage so you won't lose your list by reloading the window or closing the browser.
